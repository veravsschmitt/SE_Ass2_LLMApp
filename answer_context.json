    "text in study notes: Illumination Models. Description of the factors that influence the color and light intensity at a point.\nLocal illumination models: only pixel-light interaction, pipeline approach, local information, heuristic approximation, simpler than global. e.g. Phong illumination model & polygonal shading.\nGlobal illumination models: consider all objects in a scene when computing light at a specific point – global information e.g., radiosity and raytracing",
    "question: What is the difference between a local and a global illumination model?",
    "answer: The local model only lights up some objects, while in the global model all objects in the secene have light.",
    "check: The answer is NOT CORRECT. The difference is that the local model only uses local information (only the interaction of teh current pixel and teh light), while the global model uses the infrmation of all objects in teh scene."
